# TextJustification Program

## Usage

`$ python TextJustification.py 'file.txt' 80`

* This is how you would use the program. The second argument needs to be the file name either relative or absolute and the third argument is supposed to be the linewidth. This will print the justified file in the shell however. Do put the file name in quotes. 

`$ python TextJustification.py 'file.txt' 80 > output.txt`

* If you want the output in a file you would use redirection to redirect the output to a file.
